Question1 Usage:
 

Question1.java is a program that simulates First Come First Serve, Round Robin, and Shortest Time Remaining job scheduling algorithms and prints out turnaround and waiting time statistics for all the jobs.

The programs takes in arguments from the command line. The first argument is an input file, second is algorithm type and the last argument specifies a time quantum. It is only used if the scheduling algorithm is Round Robin.

The input file is a file that contains job information.It is already sorted by job arrival time.Each job's information is on a separate line.The job information consists of integer values - process Id, arrival time and CPU time,in that order and are delimited by a comma.
 
The main method in Question1.java reads the arguments supplied and the input file,then runs the appropriate scheduling algorithm on the jobs contained in that file.
 
It then prints out the results of turnaround and waiting time for each job, and the average turnaround and waiting time for all the jobs in a table.
